## <a id="0-1-0"></a> v0.1.0

**Release Date:** February 22, 2022

### Breaking Changes

This release has the following breaking change:

* **Terraform v1.1.3**: <%= vars.product_short %> now uses Terraform v1.1.3.

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* **Provision and update operations alert you if you attempt to override plan defined properties:**
The attempt now returns an error. Previously these commands would accept the
property change request, but override your change with the plan defined value.

* **Validation of parameters:** When additional JSON parameters are supplied as part of
`cf create-service`, `cf update-service`, `cf bind-service`, or `cf create-service-key` they are now
validated against the list of supported parameters. The operation fails if a parameter is unknown.

### Resolved issues

This release has the following fix:

* **Parameters persist through multiple updates:**
Parameters sent when updating a service are now stored and don't need to be sent again in subsequent
updates.
