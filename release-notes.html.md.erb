### Features

New features and changes in this release.

#### General

- Terraform upgraded to v1.5.7:

 The Terraform version used to apply changes is upgraded to v1.5.7. You must upgrade all service instances. When 
 you upgrade, ensure that you follow the [Upgrade procedure](upgrading.html.md.erb#procedure).


### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fixes:

- **Prevent performance degradation of database consistency checks at startup**

  Previously the <%= vars.product_short %> kept information in the database
  about instances and bindings that had already been destroyed. In the long
  term, this caused the Cloud Service Broker's database space usage to
  grow with no benefit. In some rare scenarios, this made Cloud Service Broker
  start up slower and caused the platform to timeout. The <%=
  vars.product_short %> now physically deletes information from destroyed
  assets, preventing this situation from happening.

### Known issues

There are no known issues in this release.
