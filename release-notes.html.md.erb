## <a id="1-2-0"></a> v1.2.0

**Release Date:** MMM DD, YYYY

### Breaking Changes

This release has the following breaking changes:

#### Google MySQL

- **`cores` property removed:**
  The `cores` property no longer exists and is not configurable.
  Use the `tier` property instead to define compute and memory capacity.
  The old custom plans containing the property `cores` must be changed. For more information, see
  [Changing custom plans](upgrading.html.md.erb#gcp-changing-custom-plans).

#### Google Cloud Storage

- **Format for binding credentials changed:**
  From this version onwards, the format for binding credentials has changed and only uses the `snake_case` style and not a combination of them.
  For more information about the format, see the [reference](reference/gcp-storage.html.md.erb#binding-creds) section.
  You must adapt your application to correctly read the properties exposed in the binding credentials.


### Features

New features and changes in this release:

#### Google MySQL

- **`tier` property exposed:**
  The `tier` property is now configurable at plan creation or instance operations for Google MySQL.
  The `tier` property determines the computation and memory capacity of a Google MySQL database instance.

- **Storage auto-scaling controls exposed:**
  New properties are exposed to control the storage auto-scaling functionality.
  You can change the behavior through these properties:

  - `disk_autoresize`: Enables auto-resizing of the storage size. It is `true` by default.
    When deactivating the storage auto-resizing, the value of the `disk_autoresize_limit` must also
    be set to 0.
  - `disk_autoresize_limit`: The maximum size in GB to which storage capacity can be automatically
    increased. The default value is 0, which specifies that there is no limit.

- **MySQL version is exposed:**
  Previously the parameter `mysql_version` was restricted to a property plan.
  You can now choose the version you want when creating a plan or creating and updating the instance.
  This property is required if it is not defined in the plan.

- **`deletion_protection` can be configured and updated:**
  Added a property that enables you to configure the deletion protection for the MySQL database in the
  plan configuration or during provision or update operations. By default, the protection is deactivated.

- **Maximum storage capacity limit removed:**
  The maximum storage capacity limit no longer exists. From now on, you can select the storage
  capacity that you want.
  To understand the limits, see the
  [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/quotas#storage_limits).
  The capacity cannot be reduced later.

- **Backups are now configurable:**
  Regular backups are enabled by default, and you can configure them by using the following properties:

  - `backups_retain_number`: How many backups to retain. Setting this property to `0` deactivates
    regular backups.
  - `backups_location`: (Optional) Name of a specific GCP region in which to store backups.
    When left unspecified, multi-regional storage is used.
  - `backups_start_time`: Preferred time, in the format `HH:MM`, to start daily regular backups.
    It is `07:00` by default.
  - `backups_transaction_log_retention_days`: Controls the number of days to keep the transaction logs.
    It is `0` by default. Up to 7 days of transaction logs can be stored.

- **Longer password for the admin user:**
  The length of the auto-generated password for the admin user is extended to 64 characters.

- **Configure MySQL plans from Tanzu Ops Manager:**
  You can now use Tanzu Ops Manager to add custom plans from the new MySQL configuration section in
  the broker's general configuration.

- **GCP MySQL pre-configured plans were removed:**
  From this version onwards, plans are no longer provided with the brokerpak.
  If you have GCP MySQL service instances that were using built-in plans and that you want to maintain,
  previously provided plans must be added through the tile configuration.
  For more information, see
  [Add previously provided pre-configured plans](reference/gcp-mysql.html.md.erb#old-plans).

- **MySQL database server can be assigned a public IP address:**
  A public IP address isn't assigned by default, but can be enabled by using the `public_ip` property.
  When the public IP address is assigned, access is only allowed from the networks specified by the
  `authorized_networks_cidrs` property. For more information about using a public IP address for MySQL,
  see the [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/configure-ip).

- **MySQL connection encryption:**
  All MySQL connections are now encrypted. The binding credentials include certificates that can be used
  for verifying the connection.

- **Simplified network configuration:** The property `authorized_network` has been removed.
  From now on, you can configure the networking by using only the `authorized_network_id` property, in other words,
  by using the id of the Google Compute Engine network to which the instance is connected.
  If left unspecified, the default network of the region will be used.
  For more information about the upgrade process, see the [authorized network section](upgrading.html.md.erb#gcp-mysql-authorized-network-id).
