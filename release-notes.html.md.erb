### Features

New features and changes in this release:

#### Google MySQL

- **`tier` property exposed:**
  The `tier` property is now configurable at plan creation or instance operations for Google MySQL.
  The `tier` property determines the computation and memory capacity of a Google MySQL database instance.

- **Storage auto-scaling controls exposed:**
  New properties has been exposed to control the storage auto-scaling functionality.
  You can change the behaviour through these properties:
  
  - `disk_autoresize`: Enables auto-resizing of the storage size.
  Defaults to `true`.
  If the value of the `disk_autoresize_limit` is other than 0, and you want to disable the functionality,
  it will be necessary to set the property `disk_autoresize_limit` to zero and set `disk_autoresize` to false.
  - `disk_autoresize_limit`: The maximum size in GB to which storage capacity can be automatically increased.
  The default value is 0, which specifies that there is no limit.

- **MySQL version is exposed:**
  Previously the parameter mysql_version was restricted to a property plan. You can now choose the version you want
  when creating a plan or creating and updating the instance.
  This property is required if it is not defined in the plan.

- **Maximum storage capacity limit removed:**
  The maximum storage capacity limit has been removed. From now on, you can select a storage capacity of up to 65 TB.
  Capacity cannot be reduced later.
