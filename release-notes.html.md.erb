## <a id="1-1-0"></a> v1.1.0

**Release Date:** July 27, 2022

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* **Terraform version update:**  Teraform version is now 1.2.4. All previous instances can be upgraded to this version.
 Upgrades are only supported for Terraform versions >= 0.12.0
* **New upgrade-all-instances task:** Operator can choose if they want to upgrade all instances to the latest version of the brokerpak while deploying the broker.
By default all instances will be upgraded. Update, bind, unbind and delete operations on an instance are blocked if an upgrade is available and has not been applied yet.
* **Flexible region property:** Previously brokerpak specified regions that could be used with each service and as the supported regions in the IaaS changed tile upgrade was required in order to enable those.
Since this version any supported IaaS region for the specific service will work.

### Resolved issues

* **Data loss prevention:**
  * Added additional checks to prevent service instance recreation during an update.
  * `region` is not updatable in BigQuery and Storage services anymore as it results in the
recreation of the service instance and loss of data.
* **Service instance deletion:** Fixed an issue that caused a service instance deletion request to fail if the instance was still in `Create in progress` state.
* **Redis and Dataproc updates no longer cause instance recreation:** Default IaaS instance names set by the brokerpak now rely on the request instance ID. It was previously relying on a
timestamp and this was causing updates to update the name and therefore to destroy the instance.

### Known issues

There are no known issues for this release.
