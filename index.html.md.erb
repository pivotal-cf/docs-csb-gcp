<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

> **Warning:** Some of the <%= vars.product_full %> tile services are currently in beta and are
intended for evaluation and test purposes only. Do not use them in a production environment.
Read the documentation for a service to see if it is in beta.

This documentation describes the <%= vars.product_full %>.

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

The <%= vars.product_full %> enables platform operators to expose services to their developers
from Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with a Terraform provider.
<%= vars.product_short %> is thoroughly extensible, and can expose new services or public clouds
by using custom brokerpaks.

## <a id='features'></a> Key Features

<%= vars.product_short %> includes the following key features:

- **Easily extensible and maintainable:** <%= vars.product_short %> uses brokerpaks to expose
services. Using the GCP Terraform provider, you can provision services
by using a common interface using standard Cloud Foundry CLI (cf CLI) commands.
For more information about brokerpaks, see
[Brokerpak Introduction](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud-service-broker/blob/main/docs/brokerpak-intro.md)
in GitHub.
- **One common broker for all brokered services:** <%= vars.product_short %> decouples the service
broker function from the catalog of services that it exposes.
- **CredHub integration out-of-the-box:** CredHub encrypts and manages all the secrets associated
with your use of cloud services.
- **Encryption of sensitive fields:** CSB can encrypt any sensitive data that are stored in the brokers own database.
- **Community:** When you expose a service using a brokerpak, you can make it available to
everyone who uses <%= vars.product_short %> and the reverse.
