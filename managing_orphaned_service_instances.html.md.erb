## <a id="overview-orphans"></a> Section 1: Overview of Orphaned Service Instances

In the context of the CSB for GCP and Cloud Foundry environments, it's essential to understand what constitutes orphaned service instances, why they occur, and the best practices for managing them.

### <a id="what-is-orphan"></a> What Is an Orphaned Service Instance?

- **Definition**: An orphaned service instance refers to a service instance that Cloud Foundry recognizes as part of the CSB, but CSB lacks the necessary information to manage it effectively.
- **Implications**: Having orphaned instances in your Cloud Foundry environment can lead to challenges in manageability, upgradeability, agility, and security:
    - **Manageability**: These instances cannot have their configurations changed when required.
    - **Upgradeability**: These instances cannot be upgraded when required.
    - **Agility**: Management of these instances can become critical at inopportune moments.
    - **Security**: Inability to manage these instances can pose significant security risks, especially in situations
      requiring immediate response.

### <a id="why-orphans"></a> Why Do Orphaned Instances Exist?

- **Service removal**: Instances can become orphaned due when the service to which they belong is removed, either for strategic reasons or other considerations.
- **Plan removal**: Instances can become orphaned due to the removal of plans, either for strategic reasons or other considerations.
- **Custom plan changes**: Upgrades in CSB can lead to the removal of old custom plans, which can also cause orphaned instances.
- **Plan ID changes**: Altering the Plan ID in the service catalog can lead to the treatment of existing resources as
  different, resulting in orphaned instances. This is because CSB views the modified plan ID as a new resource, disconnected from its original configuration and management context.

### <a id="actions-for-orphans"></a> Recommended Actions for Orphaned Instances

When the <%= vars.product_short %> is upgraded or configuration changes are made to plans, check
for orphaned service instances. For more information, see <a href="#detecting-orphans">detecting orphaned service instances</a>.

## <a id="orphan-strategies"></a> Section 3: Strategies for Handling Orphaned Instances

Section 3 outlines the steps and strategies necessary for effectively managing and resolving issues
related to orphaned service instances in CSB for GCP and Cloud Foundry environments.

### <a id="address-new-orphans"></a> Options for Addressing Newly Orphaned Instances

If an orphaned service instance was created with the current version of the <%= vars.product_short %>, you can resolve it by doing one of the following:

1. **Move to a new plan**: when a service instance belongs to a deactivated plan, you can update the service instance
   to be associated with a valid plan. First, identify a valid plan for the service instance, then issue a command
   to update the plan. Changing a plan may update the service instance properties to match the default properties of the new plan.

   ```shell
   cf update-service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME -p NEW-PLAN-NAME
   ```

Where:
- `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` is the name of the service instance.
- `NEW-PLAN-NAME` is the name of the valid plan that you have chosen.

1. **Restore removed plans**: you may choose to restore a plan that was removed. To do this, update the plan configuration in
   the tile. The plan must have the same name, ID, and properties as before.
   See <a href="./installing-with-gcp.html.md.erb#services">configure services with <%= vars.product_short %></a> for more information.

### <a id="address-old-orphans"></a> Options for Addressing Historic Orphaned Instances

If an orphaned service instance was created with a previous version of the <%= vars.product_short %>, it is not possible to
resume management of the service instance with a later version of the <%= vars.product_short %>. In such cases, your options include:

1. **Transitioning to a user-provided service instance**: You can keep the service instance in GCP, but it will
   no longer be managed by the <%= vars.product_short %>. Instead, it becomes a user-provided service instance.
    - Obtain the credentials of the service instance from CredHub.
    - Use the `cf create-user-provided-service` command to create a new service instance with the credentials.
    - Bind Apps to the new user-provided service instance.
    - Restart the Apps.
    - Purge the orphaned service instance by using the `cf purge-service-instance` command.

2. **Remove the service instance**: You can remove the service instance. To do this:
    - Back up any data that you want to retain from the service instance. You could import this data into a newly created service instance if desired.
    - Remove the service instance through the GCP console or CLI.
    - Purge the service instance from CloudFoundry by using the `cf purge-service-instance` command.
    - Log into the <%= vars.product_short %> app with `cf ssh <app name>` and then run the command
      `app/cloud-service-broker purge <service instance id>`. This removes data about the service instance and all binding from the <%= vars.product_short %> database.

### <a id="if-ignore-orphans"></a> Implications of Ignoring Orphaned Instances

- Neglecting orphaned instances during CSB updates can lead to an unhealthy environment.
- Upgrade instructions for custom plans related to orphaned instances can become ineffective, necessitating manual migration.
