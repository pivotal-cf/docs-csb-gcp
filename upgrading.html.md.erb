Would you like to upgrade <%= vars.product_full %>? This topic tells you about
the [Upgrade procedure](#procedure), [Upgrading service
instances](#upgrade-instances), and specific details about [Upgrading to
v1.3](#upgrading-specifics).

## <a id="procedure"></a> Upgrade procedure

>**Important**
>When upgrading <%= vars.product_short %>, service instances might need to be
   upgraded. Failure to upgrade one or more instance does not cause the tile
   installation to fail.

>Review the `deploy-all` errand logs in the change log to verify
   that no errors occurred when upgrading instances.

## <a id="procedure"></a> Upgrade procedure

To upgrade <%= vars.product_short %>:

1. Before you stage the new tile version, [verify that all service instances are
   up to date](#upgrade-instances).

   > **Important** The installation process will stop if there are any outdated instances.
   > You will have to manually upgrade any outdated instances by following the instructions in
   > [Upgrade instances through the CLI plug-in](#upgrading-cli-plugin") before retrying the installation.
   > We recommend manually checking if there are any instances to update before starting the
   > installation process.

2. Download the new version of <%= vars.product_short %> from [<%=
   vars.product_network
   %>](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/cloud-service-broker-gcp/).

3. Stage and configure the tile by following the instructions in [Installing
    with GCP](installing-with-gcp.html.md.erb).

4. Make all the changes described in [Upgrading to v1.3](#upgrading-specifics).

5. Verify that your configuration complies with the [important notes about
   upgrading service instances](#upgrade-notes), especially regarding upgrading
   all instances of config, plans, and beta offerings.

6. Go to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

7. Click **Review Pending Changes** and then click **Apply Changes**.

8. Review the `deploy-all` errand logs for any errors created because of the
   upgrade instances task.

## <a id="upgrade-instances"></a> Verify that service instances are up to date before upgrading the tile

Service instances that haven't been upgraded with one version of the tile might
not be upgradable by a later version. 

A step in the installation phase will stop the process if there are any outdated instances.

For these reasons, verify that there are no service instances pending upgrade before staging
the new version of the tile.

You can see whether there are instances with a pending upgrade by using the CLI plug-in. 
See more information about [ensuring all instances are up to date with the CLI plug-in](#checking-cli-plugin)
and the `-dry-run` or `check-up-to-date` flags that output the list of instances pending upgrade.
If you find instances that are pending upgrade, follow the upgrading
instructions for your current version.

### <a id="upgrade-notes"></a> Important notes about upgrading service instances

Before you start upgrading service instances, see the following notes:

- **Select the Upgrade all services check box:**

  If the **Upgrade all services** check box is not selected, service instances
  are not upgraded during installation. These instances become unmanageable by
  the broker. Any operations on that instance, such as update, bind, unbind, or
  delete, are blocked until you run the upgrade task. You can run the upgrade
  task at any time before upgrading the product to a later version. For
  information about how to configure this task, see [Upgrade All Service
  Instances configuration](installing-with-gcp.html.md.erb#upgrade-all-config).
  Alternatively, run the upgrade at a later stage using the [CLI
  plug-in](#upgrading-cli-plugin).

- **Select the Enable Beta offerings check box:**

  If the **Enable Beta offerings** check box is not selected when applying
  changes, instances from those service offerings are not upgraded. These
  instances become unmanageable by the broker. Verify that the **Enable Beta
  offerings** check box is selected if you have instances from those offerings
  that you intend to keep updated.

- **Deleting custom plans:**

  If you delete custom plans before upgrading all instances, instances from
  these plans are not upgraded. These instances become unmanageable by the
  broker. Delete plans after upgrading all instances, or see [Release Notes for
  Cloud Service Broker for GCP](release-notes.html.md.erb) and [Upgrading to
  v1.3](#upgrading-specifics) to prevent conflicting upgrades.

- **Only upgrade the tile after all service instances are up to date:**

  You can run the upgrade all instances task as many times as needed. If
  you prefer, run the upgrade all instances task by using the cf CLI
  instead of, or in addition to, running it through the tile. Failure to upgrade
  one or more instances does not cause the tile installation to fail. Review the
  `deploy all` errand logs to verify that all instances have upgraded.

### <a id="checking-cli-plugin"></a> Verify that all instances are up to date with the CLI plug-in

To verify that no instances are pending upgrade:

1. Install the [cf CLI UpgradeAllServices
   plugin](https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org/#UpgradeAllServices) on Cloud Foundry.
2. Follow the instructions in the **Usage** section of the `README` in the
   [upgrade-all-services-cli-plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/upgrade-all-services-cli-plugin#usage)
   GitHub repository to perform a dry run or a check up to date command.

   For example:

   ```
   cf upgrade-all-services BROKER-NAME -dry-run
   ```

   Or:

   ```
   cf upgrade-all-services BROKER-NAME -check-up-to-date
   ```

These commands provide a list of instances from enabled plans pending upgrade. If
the list is not empty, upgrade the instances listed before attempting a tile
upgrade.

### <a id="upgrading-cli-plugin"></a> Upgrade instances through the CLI plug-in

To run the cf CLI plug-in:

1. Install the [cf CLI UpgradeAllServices
   plugin](https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org/#UpgradeAllServices) on Cloud Foundry.
1. To run the upgrade, follow the instructions in the **Usage** section of the
   `README` in the
   [upgrade-all-services-cli-plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/upgrade-all-services-cli-plugin#usage)
   GitHub repository.

   For example:

   ```
   cf upgrade-all-services BROKER-NAME
   ```

Run the CLI plug-in with the `-dry-run` or `check-up-to-date` flags before applying the service
instance upgrade to find out which instances are pending upgrade.
