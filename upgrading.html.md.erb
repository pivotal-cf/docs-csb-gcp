This topic describes how to upgrade <%= vars.product_full %>.

## <a id="upgrade-to-1-1"></a> Upgrading from 1.0 to 1.1

  If you have Redis or Dataproc instances created with previous versions of the <%= vars.product_short %>
  without explicitly passing a value for `instance_id` for Redis or `name` for Dataproc you will have to update
  those instances before installing this version.

  For Redis instances run

```
  cf update-service your-redis-si -c '{"instance_id":"<current-name-from-GCP-console>"}'
```

  For Dataproc instances run

```
  cf update-service your-dataproc-si -c '{"name":"<current-name-from-GCP-console>"}'
```

## <a id="upgrade-to-1-0"></a> Upgrading from Beta to 1.0

Due to differences in the PostgreSQL service offering, it is not possible to upgrade
beta instances to v1.0.
You must delete all previously created service instances before upgrading <%= vars.product_short %> from v0.2 to v1.0.

If you want to retain beta instances in the IaaS, you can remove them from Cloud Foundry.
<%= vars.product_short %> will no longer manage these instances.

To remove the instances from Cloud Foundry, run the command:

```
cf purge-service-instance
```

## <a id="procedure"></a> Upgrade Procedure

To upgrade the <%= vars.product_short %> to a later version:

1. Download the new version of <%= vars.product_short %> from [<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/cloud-service-broker-gcp/).
1. Follow the procedure in [Installing with GCP](installing-with-gcp.html).
1. If you are upgrading to a version later than v1.0, service instances might need to be upgraded.
Before installing the new version, see [Upgrade All Service Instances Config](installing-with-gcp.html#upgrade-all-config)
